# AutoClicker

This project was an old project but has been recently maintained with the production of the readme, slimming the codebase down [by removing redundant code], adding some security to the code (whilst tryint to make it more user friendly), and making it slightly more efficient. 

This program allows you to automatically click anywhere on the screen. 

Features:
- Add a custom interval between clicks.
- Test Button to test the speed & see if the autoclicker is working [Left Click only].
- Selection for left or right click [and for single or double click]
- Selection for repeating clicking until stopped or click a certain amount of times.
- Add a click delay (time between starting the program and clicking starting)
- Allows for clicking wherever the user leaves the mouse or to click in a specific position, set when user clicks "Pick Location" and follows the instructions.
- Start and stop automatic clicking with "F6" <- Only works when the window is focused aka it doesnt work as you think it does.
